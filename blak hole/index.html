            <h1>THE SHAPE OF BLACK HOLE</h1></div>
            <span>When we first teach undergrads about black holes and their structure we explain that they only really have two regions of interest: the event horizon and the singularity at the center. The geometry of the event horizon varies with the type of blackhole, but in the simplest case - known as the Schwarzschild blackhole - this is the surface of a sphere whose radius is proportional to the object's mass. As other people have pointed out, nothing within this radius can ever leave since the escape velocity becomes greater than the speed of light.

               The central singularity is a point where, in the context of Einstein's general relativity, spacetime's curvature becomes infinite. This is what leads to the confusion about a blackhole's "shape" being cone-like. Images like this one are meant to show that spacetime becomes highly curved as one goes closer to the blackhole's center. Unfortunately in a cartoon only two dimensions can be included since the third spatial dimension ("Y" in this case) is used to show the extent of spacetime's curvature or strength of gravity. A more complete diagram would require three dimensions for space, a fourth axis for time, and a fifth axis on which to plot spacetime's curvature. You can imagine why people stick to approximate representations like these ones!
               
               
               
               So it depends on your definition of the "shape" of a blackhole, but I suspect most astrophysicists would be perfectly comfortable describing a blackhole's shape by the geometry of its event horizon. For a Schwarzschild blackhole this is a sphere.

            What is a Black Hole?
A black hole is a place in space where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape from it, including light. It is invisible to human eyes. When a black hole and a star are close, high-energy light is made. Scientists use satellites and telescopes in space to see that light. Also, some black holes emit X-rays in all directions. Telescopes measure the X-ray light, and scientists use this information to learn more about black holes. There are four types of black holes, viz. stellar, intermediate, supermassive, and miniature.

How is a Black Hole Formed?
When stars die (when there is no fuel to burn), most of them inflate, lose mass, and then cool to form white dwarfs. But the massive stars that are typically 10-20 times massive than our Sun either become neutron stars or stellar-mass black holes.


When a huge star explodes (supernova), it leaves behind the core. When the star is alive, nuclear fusions create constant outward push that balances the inward pull of gravity from its own mass but in the remnant of a supernova, there are no longer forces to oppose that gravity, so the star core begins to collapse in on itself. If its mass collapses into an infinitely small point, a black hole is born. A black hole continuously grows by absorbing gas and interstellar dust from its surroundings.

Similarities between Lord Shiva and a Black Hole:
Meaning of the Word Shiva:
In folk etymology, the roots of the word śiva are śī which means “in whom all things lie; pervasiveness” and “va” which means “embodiment of grace.” Therefore, Shiva means “an embodiment of grace that is all-pervasive.”

Why is Lord Shiva called the Destroyer?
We know that Lord Shiva destroys the whole universe, but we do not know how he does so. The Hindu scriptures say that he does so with the Tandava dance, which is metaphoric to creation, sustenance, and destruction of the universe but it sounds cryptic and is beyond understanding. Then, can there be a scientific reason behind why he is called the destroyer?

According to the Big Bang theory, the universe at the beginning was very hot and confined to a small point called the initial singularity. It is currently expanding, but there would be a point when it would stop doing so and start contracting and end in a singularity. That point would be a black hole that would consume everything. Therefore, we can say that a black hole is a symbol of destructive power.


This functionality of the universe is controlled by Lord Shiva, and therefore, he is called “the destroyer.”

Scriptural Evidence that links Lord Shiva to a Black Hole:

1. The Subala Upanishad (2:4) says that at the time of the dissolution of the manifested universe all matter merges into darkness before being reabsorbed into the Brahman. Likewise, the universe re-emerges from the darkness.

Linga Purana says Lord Shiva is the substratum of Brahman. Therefore, the darkness mentioned above symbolically represents Lord Shiva.

<h2></h2> 2. In the Skanda Purana, Lord Shiva says that the whole universe is born out of the linga and would ultimately dissolve into it. The same concept is mentioned in the other Puranas also.


What does this mean? It means that the linga symbolically represents a black hole, and the whole world was born out of it and would dissolve into it.

The Scientific Meaning of the Story of Lingodbhava:
In the story of Lingodbhava, it is mentioned that before creation, Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu were quarreling over superiority. Then suddenly from nowhere, a column of fire appears in between them, and Lord Shiva and the goddess Uma come out of it. Lord Shiva tells them that they have forgotten that they are born out of him.


After reading this story, several questions come into mind. If there was nothing, then where were those gods standing, and where was that column of fire located? Why were gods fighting for superiority?

We can find the clues to solve this puzzle in the names and Hindu iconography.

In this story, Lord Brahma is symbolically represented as the universe (Brahmanda), Lord Vishnu as the matter [Vishwa (world) + Anu (atom)], Goddess Uma or Shakti as the energy, and Lord Shiva as a black hole!

The symbol of the lotus is of great significance in Hinduism. Lord Brahma is mostly depicted as sitting on an opened lotus flower coming out of the navel of Lord Vishnu. A lotus bud looks like Hiranyagarbha. A lotus has 18 petals, and 9 (1+8) is a sacred number in Hinduism.

Therefore, Brahma coming out of a lotus actually symbolizes Brahmanda, i.e., the universe.

Lord Brahma, born out of the lotus coming out of the navel of Lord Vishnu, symbolizes Brahmanda is made up of matter.

In this story, Lord Shiva is depicted as superior to Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma, and Lord Shiva says that they were born out of him. He says so because matter and the whole universe were created (born) out of a black hole. The column of fire is the blast coming out of the exploded cosmic egg. As it was traveling at the speed of light, Lord Brahma and Lord Vishnu could not find its end. The AUM sound was produced at that moment. Therefore, the Shiva lingam represents the moment of creation.

In the Puranas, Lord Vishnu is also called the creator of the universe.

      Tamil Nadu's ADGP, Sandeep Mittal, on Tuesday tweeted that NASA's viral audio of a black hole's sound was in fact the 'om' sound, one of the most sacred words in Hinduism. The Indian Police Service officer said," This sound has been named Om by our sages. The advent of the universe and its end -- everything is Om. This sound has the capacity to bring about the end of the world. This is more impactful than anything, organism, or planet. When we say it is called superstition, but when NASA says it is science". The highly educated officer is being brutally trolled on Twitter for his remark.

A user named Samir Ansari tweeted to Tamil Nadu Chief Minister MK Stalin sarcastically saying," Your state will achieve new heights under such people".
